### task

**Task:** create an API generating PDF reports and a UI requesting and downloading these reports. Report format and data are your choice. It could be any table data. Node.js/React is preferable but not mandatory. The result is to be presented as a Git repo (even if it goes as an archive).

**Hint:** both API and UI should be able to handle long-lasting requests/jobs.

**Idea:** kline/candlestick bars for crypto token market data.
